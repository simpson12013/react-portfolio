            <p class="text-faded mb-4">I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in 2018, with majors in Cello Performance and Music Theory. Balancing these two areas of study instilled in me the importance of time management, work ethic, and passion. Throughout my college career, I loved working within and modeling the abstract logic systems found in Music Theory. As I came to the decision to diverge from music as a career path, I searched for another outlet to complement my skills in creative problem-solving and analysis. This has led me to pursue a career in data science. Having graduated from KUâ€™s data analytics program, I am excited to apply my newly-discovered passion for programming to the opportunities that lie ahead.
